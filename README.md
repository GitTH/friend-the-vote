# Friend the Vote

Friend the Vote is an online tool put together during the 2012 election cycle to encourage voting through Facebook. The app utilizes the Facebook API via JavaScript and is built on the [Hifi](http://gethifi.com) CMS.

Political campaigns and organizations can use this Friend the Vote as an online approach to get-out-the-vote leading up to Election Day. The message and image can be customized for the campaign to encourage voting for the particular candidate. During the 2012 cycle, over 50 campaigns were listed and voters in every state in the U.S. could use the app.

FriendtheVote.com builds off of [research by the University of California](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/13/science/la-sci-facebook-elections-20120913) in 2012 that concluded get-out-the-vote efforts on Facebook can have a measurable, real-world effect on turnout and involvement.
